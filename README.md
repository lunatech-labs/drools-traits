# Drools Expert: traits examples

This project is a simple Java main class that executes some rules and uses logging for output. The examples calculate the initial values of a few [integer sequences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Integer_sequences).

## Dependencies

This code is developed for Drools 5.5.0.Final.

## Usage

Add `src` directory and the JAR files in `drools-5.5.0.Final/binaries/` to the runtime classpath, and run the `com.lunatech.drools.traits.RulesService` class.
